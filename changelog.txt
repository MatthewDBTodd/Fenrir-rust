0.0001 - basic engine with negamax, alpha-beta pruning, iterative deepening,
transposition tables

0.0002 - introduced very basic piece-square tables, though currently without
separate ones for the endgame

0.0003 - introduced a basic quiescence search which seems to have dramatically
improved the strength of the engine. It beat v0.0002 47.5-14.5 with an elo
gain of ~200
